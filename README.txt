==Oxford buses==

This app uses the reverse engineered api shown here:
http://blogs.oucs.ox.ac.uk/inapickle/2010/01/14/live-bus-locations-from-acis-oxontime/

To get this app to run you will need a google maps api key from here:
http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.htm

Which needs to be replaced in the android manifest file.
